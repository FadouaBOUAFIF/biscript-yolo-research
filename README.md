# BiScript-YOLO: Dynamic Adaptation for Cross-Script Handwritten Zone Detection

# Description
Master's research project on adaptive handwritten text detection in bilingual documents using modified YOLOv8 architecture.

# Objectives
- Develop a YOLOv8 model with dynamic script routing
- Handle Arabic and Latin scripts in the same model
- Improve cross-script generalization
